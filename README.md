# Login-Stress-Testing-Tool
🚀 This project is a Login Stress Testing Tool designed for ethical security testing of authentication systems. It helps system administrators, security researchers, and developers evaluate how their server handles multiple login attempts, ensuring robust account lockout policies and resilience against brute-force attacks.

🛠 Features:
✅ Automated Login Attempts: Simulates multiple login requests to test server performance.
✅ Lockout Policy Verification: Checks if accounts are locked after a set number of failed attempts.
✅ Customizable Usernames & Passwords: Allows testing with different user credentials.
✅ Popup Handling: Detects and dismisses popups that may appear during login attempts.
✅ Headless Mode: Runs without displaying the browser, improving efficiency.
✅ Error Handling & Logging: Tracks login failures, account lockout status, and system responses.

🎯 Use Cases:
🔹 ✅ Load Testing Authentication Systems:

Ensures the server can handle multiple login attempts without performance degradation.
🔹 ✅ Security Testing & Account Lockout Validation:

Tests if the system blocks repeated failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
🔹 ✅ Detecting Login Rate-Limiting Issues:

Ensures the system enforces login cooldowns after multiple failures.
🔹 ✅ Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing:

Helps security teams and ethical hackers analyze vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms.
🔹 ✅ Cybersecurity Education & Awareness:

Used for training developers and security professionals in real-world login attack simulations.
